# All about me!

Hello! I'm glad you decided to check out my blog and learn more about me!
I live in Portland, Oregon and have lived here for most of my life. I was 
born in Canada but moved here when I was quite young. So although I may not 
be an American by birth, I have lived here long enough to be just about 
indistinguishable from the common _rabble_.

## What do I like to do?

I like to play video games, watch tv, **sleep**, read and that's about it.
Not the most interesting person but I do enjoy my simple pleasures. 

## Favorite food and vacation sites

My favorite food is hands down pizza. I **_lOVE_** pizza. I like many different
kinds as well. All pizza is good. It's a phenomenal invention that makes all of
our lives better. It just simply makes this world a better place. Thank the heavens 
for pizza!

My favorite vacation sites are:

* Hawaii
* Portugal
* Canada
* Europe
* Mexico

I haven't been to some of these places yet, but I can't wait to visit them all. Isn't
it amazing that in this day and age we can truly have the opportunity to see this entire world.
